							<br><br>
							Throughout my current role as a data analyst for the last 11 years, I started 
							teaching myself to program on the side in order to reduce the time spent 
							on repetitive processes and found a passion in that process. Over the last 
							two years, I’ve been using that passion to fuel the work needed for a new 
							degree in Computer Science so I can push my knowledge and skills even further. 
							Now it’s time to take that next step and turn that passion into a full time career.

				<span class="title">Personal projects</span><br>
				I have recently become interested in programming with a Raspberry Pi and Arduinos and have enjoyed 
				working on a few personal projects such as Halloween decorations, an autonomous vehicle, 
				and an IOT device.

						<img src="pics/thumb_project2.jpg" alt="thumb_project2" id="projectThumbnail">
						I took an existing jack-o-lantern decoration I had and added
						flashing lights and audio, which can be triggered from a webapp.
						This project uses a Raspberry Pi, Blinkt LED strip, and a 
						small speaker. The webapp is hosted on the Raspberry Pi using
						Flask for the webserver. There are several preprogrammed options
						for the different sounds and lights. The light patterns are simply 
						changes between three colors, with random delays between flashes 
						and random brightness for each flash. Everything is written using 
						Python.

					<td><p><span class="location">Halloween Strobe Light</span><br>
						<img src="pics/thumb_project1.jpg" alt="thumb_project1" id="projectThumbnail">
						This was my first project after getting a Raspberry Pi. This uses 
						just the Raspberry Pi and a Blinkt LED strip. Once the script 
						is started, it simply randomly selects a color and a brightness to flash, 
						as well as a random delay between flashes to create a 
						'Rainbow Strobe Light'. The script would auto run when the Pi
						started up, and I was able to power the Pi through a portable battery
						pack which made it portable and perfect for a front window backdrop.
