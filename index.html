		<p>I'm self-motivated, detail oriented, and looking to redesign my future as a software engineer where I can not only utilize my
			existing skill set, but also continue to grow and learn while contributing to the development of innovative software solutions.
			<br><br>
			Throughout my current role as a data analyst for the last 11 years, I started teaching myself to program on the side in order 
			to reduce the time spent on repetitive processes and found a passion in that process. Over the last two years, I’ve been 
			using that passion to fuel the work needed for a new degree in Computer Science so I can push my knowledge and skills 
			even further. Now it’s time to take that next step and turn that passion into a full time career.
